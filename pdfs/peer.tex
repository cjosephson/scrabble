\subsection*{Predicting Student Learning Outcomes in Computer Science}

This poster talks about a ML approach to predicting student outcomes based on course evaluations. It's an interesting idea, but the results section didn't really give me a strong indication of how well it worked. The discussion had some stats on what phrases were tied to positive and negative performance. Of note is that 'prefers collaboration' is linked to negative performance.

\subsection*{Sentiment Analysis of GIFs}
I liked this project because it is a technology I would find useful--sometimes I'm looking for a GIF that expresses a particular emotion, and current search tools don't do that very well. I wish there had been a specific example of their classifier input/output.

\subsection*{Lyrics Based Classification of Songs}
We were considering doing a (non-lyrics based) genre predictor for our own project before settling on a Scrabble AI, so this project caught my eye. Instead of extracting features like spectrum, beats, note onsets, etc. he attempts to classify it based on lyrics alone. Features included word count, word frequency, expletives, etc. It was pretty accurate for rap, surprisingly inaccurate for country.

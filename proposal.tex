By turning in this assignment, I agree by the Stanford honor code and
declare that all of this is my own work.

\section*{Requirements}
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
  \item  Define the input-output behavior of the system and the scope of the project.
  \item  Define the evaluation metric for success
  \item  Collect some preliminary data, and give concrete examples of inputs and outputs.
  \item  Implement a baseline and an oracle and discuss the gap. What are the challenges?
  \item Which topics (e.g., search, MDPs, etc.) might be able to address those challenges (at a high-level, since we haven't covered any techniques in detail at this point)?
  \item  Search the Internet for similar projects and mention the related work.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Brainstorm}

Brinstorm ideas:
\begin{itemize}
  \item automatic scientific paper review generator
  \item 6.141-style having a robot that navigates a grid (we'd have to make a simulated robots)
  \item  motorcycle navigation (between bike and car, can cut thru certain car barriers, need better ETA (lane-splitting)  weight highly scenic roads higher
  \item how long a recipe will actually take based on skill level etc
  \item (Colleen TODO) \textbf{predict how many likes/interactions a facebook post will get depending on content ( engagement, photo present, marriage, baby, etc).}
  \item  (Becca TODO) \textbf{online troll detector}
  \item (Colleen TODO) \textbf{scrabble AI}
  \item snake.io player
  \item SET card game player (can a bot learn to play set based off example games?)
  \item (Becca TODO) \textbf{classify song genre based off mp3 (whole or partial), use aubio library}
\end{itemize}

\section{Evaluation of Feasiblity}
\subsection{Facebook like predictor}
\begin{itemize}
\item  \emph{Define the input-output behavior of the system and the scope of the project.}
  
  Input: a status update\\
  Output: a predicted number of likes
  
  \item \emph{ Define the evaluation metric for success}

    Distance between predicted likes and actual likes
    
  \item  \emph{Collect some preliminary data, and give concrete examples of inputs and outputs.}

    Data collection would use a web crawler like here:
    https://www.norconex.com/how-to-crawl-facebook/. This has
    potential issues as it violates the Facebook EULA and people have
    gotten into actual legal trouble before (see
    https://www.quora.com/Is-it-legal-to-use-a-crawler-in-order-to-collect-Facebook-public-data).

    For easy preliminary data, the authors can download their own Facebook status updates easily and with no legal issues (see https://www.facebook.com/notes/terabug/download-all-facebook-photos-status-wall-posts-together-in-zip-file/10150118571353989/).
    
    image of status update $\rightarrow$ \# predicted of likes
    
  \item  \emph{Implement a baseline and an oracle and discuss the gap. What are the challenges?}

    Baseline:\\
    Oracle:
    
  \item Which topics (e.g., search, MDPs, etc.) might be able to address those challenges (at a high-level, since we haven't covered any techniques in detail at this point)?
  \item  Search the Internet for similar projects and mention the related work.

      \item http://kbbz.github.io/
    \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Scrabble AI}
\begin{itemize}
  \item  \emph{Define the input-output behavior of the system and the scope of the project}.
  \item  \emph{Define the evaluation metric for success}
  \item  \emph{Collect some preliminary data, and give concrete examples of inputs and outputs.}
  \item  \emph{Implement a baseline and an oracle and discuss the gap. What are the challenges?}
  \item \emph{Which topics (e.g., search, MDPs, etc.) might be able to address those challenges (at a high-level, since we haven't covered any techniques in detail at this point)?}
  \item  \emph{Search the Internet for similar projects and mention the related work.}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Troll detector}
\subsection{Music genre classifier}
\begin{itemize}
  \item  \emph{Define the input-output behavior of the system and the scope of the project.}

    Input: A music song in mp3 format\\
    Output: An English-language genre tag

  \item  \emph{Define the evaluation metric for success}
    
    Binary: does the classifier guess a genre in the correct set of
    genres or not. There is a set of genres because some genres are
    umbrellas of others, e.g. Trance is a sub-genre of electronic.

  \item  \emph{Collect some preliminary data, and give concrete examples of inputs and outputs.}

    One of the authors has an extensive media collection, so using
    that and the Aubio feature extraction library we have a feature
    extractor and training/dev/test sets already.

    Example: Never Gonna Give You Up $\rightarrow$ R\&B
    
  \item \emph{Implement a baseline and an oracle and discuss the gap. What are the challenges?}

    Baseline: \\
    Oracle: 
    
  \item \emph{Which topics (e.g., search, MDPs, etc.) might be able to address those challenges (at a high-level, since we haven't covered any techniques in detail at this point)?}

    Search? IDK.
    
  \item  Search the Internet for similar projects and mention the related work.

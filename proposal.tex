By turning in this assignment, I agree by the Stanford honor code and
declare that all of this is my own work.

\section*{Requirements}
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
  \item  Define the input-output behavior of the system and the scope of the project.
  \item  Define the evaluation metric for success
  \item  Collect some preliminary data, and give concrete examples of inputs and outputs.
  \item  Implement a baseline and an oracle and discuss the gap. What are the challenges?
  \item Which topics (e.g., search, MDPs, etc.) might be able to address those challenges (at a high-level, since we haven't covered any techniques in detail at this point)?
  \item  Search the Internet for similar projects and mention the related work.
\end{enumerate}

\section{First Paragraph}
- a what player? What is this scrabble of which you speak? 

\section{Define the Problem}
  also evaluation metric, etc. 
\section{Talk About Previous Implimentations}
Maven, the open source one

\section{Talk About Oracle/Baseline}
What are we planning on using for them? Why? Why are they necessary? 
\section{Talk about code built, data collected, gap, what this signifies}
because omfg we did some stuff. 
\section{Talk about high level methods to use to solve this}
A*, probably we should skim through what other people did to copy their general methods. 
\section*{Conclusion}

Finally, blah.

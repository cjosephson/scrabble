Propose a model and an algorithm for tackling your task. You should
describe the model and algorithm in detail and use a concrete example
to demonstrate how the model and algorithm work. Don't describe
methods in general; describe precisely how they apply to your problem
(what are variables, factors, states, etc.)? You should also have
finished implementing a preliminary version of your algorithm (maybe
it's not fully optimized yet and it doesn't have all the features you
want). Report your initial experimental results.
